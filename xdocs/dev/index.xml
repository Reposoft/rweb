        <p>... as a proud Repos developer.</p>
        <subsection name="Anarchy and order">
            <p>This is an evolving product. We don't make the perfect design from the start.
            We'll prbably never make the perfect design. We are always ready to refactor and
            improve our code. We make the simplest possible solutions, and add features
            only when they are requested</p>
            <p>We mess with each other's code. If only the author understands the code, it sucks.
            Feel free to change anywhere. Using Subversion, we can always undo. Use the following
            versioning workflow:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Checkout/update</li>
                <li>Change anywhere</li>
                <li>Update and resolve conflicts</li>
                <li>Run tests to verify that everything works</li>
                <li>Commit using a revealing log message</li>
            </ol>
