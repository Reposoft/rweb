  * Gary Harris naffall@tpg.com.au 28/2/06.
  * V1.4 had been added to the SF files page but not the web page.
    Many changes had been lost and the eAccelerator version was based
    on the older version. Brought both versions back up to 1.4 spec.
  * eAccelerator version encoded but produced incorrect output. Fixed.
  * eAccelerator version also contained a number of bugs.
  * The manual now covers both encoders and is called PHPCoder Manual.htm.  
  * Numerous additional fixes including URLs.
  * NOTE: Multi-encoder version not currently updated.
