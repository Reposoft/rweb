<h1>Recommended Subversion server for Windows</h1>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support Windows 2000, XP and 2003 server</li>
  <li>Run in parallell with Internet Information Server </li>
  <li>Apache 2.0, because it is required by Subversion (2.2 is currently not supported) </li>
  <li>OpenSSL, to support Basic HTTP authentication</li>
  <li>PHP 4.3+, to be able to add web interface</li>
  <li>Subversion 1.4+</li>
</ul>
<p>All components are open source. They are standard in most Linux dsitributions, but tricky to install in Windows. When bought for self-hosting, Repos is delivered with a preconfigured server installation that meets these requirements.</p>
<h2> Running Project Engine  version control without Repos </h2>
<p>With a Project Engine enterprise license, version control support is included. To create a repository hosted on a Windows server, the Repos server installation can save a lot of time. When the repository is up and running, the Repos web application can be added at any time. </p>
