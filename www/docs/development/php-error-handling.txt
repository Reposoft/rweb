If a function detects a runtime error, like a variable value that is not according to the signature or any other error condition:
use 'trigger_error("error message", E_USER_ERROR)'.
No "die" or "exit", because that will stop any error handling logic. Normally, the function should simply return.
This behaviour is as close as we can get to Java's RuntimeException. Exceptions only available in PHP5.

For user errors, do 'trigger_error("error message", E_USER_WARNING)'.
