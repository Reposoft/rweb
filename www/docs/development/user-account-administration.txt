repos.se 1.0 has no access to the user database.
It only users the authentication from the repository.
There is no admin account.

This version of repos is simply installed as an addon to an existing subversion repository running with apache authentication.
It needs read access to the AuthzSVNAccessFile to produce the start page, where the different paths that the user can access are listed.

If Apache is configured to use a basic password file, and command line administration is not sufficient, we recommend HTAdmin:

A sample diff for the HTadmin config.inc.php is:
