Setting IDs on HTML elements

The IDs are most important for tests. Tests will have hard coded references to all buttons they click, using the id. This way they do not depend on language.

All links, buttons and form fields should have an ID.

If a button or link has a clear destination, use that as ID: 'repository' is better than 'back'.
If the page flow changes, and there is no longer a button to go to the repository, the tests have to be rewritten anyway. In contranst, the meaning of 'back' could change.

If a button is an action, use the action name. It is often the same as the destination. For example 'mkdir'.

If the action for an object in a list, use action:object.
