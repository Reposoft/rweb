----------------
The 1.0 branch is designed as an addon to an existing Subversion+Apache repository installation.

- Login to personal folder
- Logout (clear browser's credentials)
- File browsing with action buttons and links for the visited path.
- Log viewer
- Plaintext contents viewer (open any version of a file from the logs)
- Plaintext diff viewer
- Folder tree structure (showing all the folders the user can access) opened in separate page
- Create, rename and delete folders
- File upload, upload new version and delete file
- File upload (new or changed) for text files by pasting test in textarea form field
Features that require javascript:
- Javascript plugin framework for transparently adding behaviour to pages
- Date formatting with browser's time zone
- File and folder details (full URL, size, revision, author, locks) as popup
- Client side validation of form fields (filename and log message), using tmt-validator
- Automatically fill in file name at upload of new file
- Error id for javascript errors
- Chose language (english is the only language)
Administration features:
- Text-editor-like edit of Access Control List
- Add user to HTTP users file with BASIC encrypted password
- Write access to repository root directory, for creating new accounts (/username/trunk folder)
- A standard set of css classes that annotate context (for CSS and behaviours)
- Stateless server-side application except for redirect-after-post pages which use the local file system
- Backup and verify scripts (with a file structure that is easily mirrored)
- MD5 hash to verify backup file integrity
- Automated test suite for everything except multipart file upload

NOT implemented:
- User's preferences
- Change password screen
- E-mailing capabilities
- Tree navigation in the file browser
- Locking and unlocking of files
- Server side validation of input. All operations will be attempted, reporting an SVN client error if unsuccessful (But proper escaping of all input is in place).
- Handling of read-only folders (user will see a subversion error message after a write operation is attempted)
- iCalendar integration (although those who know where to look can test integration with phpicalendar and a client such as Sunbird or Mac  ICal).
- Cookies or sessions
- Help for SVN client checkout of files or WebDAV access (but connecting to the account as a windows network folder, for drag and drop, is possible)

Requirements:
- Subversion 1.2.3 or 1.3.2+
- Subversion client on webserver's command line
- Repos and Subversion runs on the same machine (repos has access to the file system location of the auth files)
- Webserver account write access to the user file and ACL 
- PHP 4.3.0+ with mbstring support (command line must also support UTF-8)
- Text file user accounts and ACL backend (standard BASIC httpasswd file and SVNAuthFile).
- Hard coded account names for admin and account manager. 
- Tested in Firefox 1.5+, IE6, and Camino. Usable but not fully functional in Safari 2.0+ and Opera 8+.
- Manually set CSS theme path in config file, central javascript file and XSLT file
