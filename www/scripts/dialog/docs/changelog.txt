NOTES:
 - "dialog" folder contains all source related to the dialogs script
 - "themeS" folder contains a "common" css with css rules that get applied to all dialogs
 - "[themename]" folder contains additional css for a particular theme. The naming convention .[themename] [cssname] distinguishes multiple themes so they can be used at the same time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
 - further optimization of code
 - combining move and resize function with MoveAndResize class
 - adding parameter for using other main container than document.window
