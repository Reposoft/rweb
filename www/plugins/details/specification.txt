repos.se details plugin
-----------------------

Looks through the page for class="details" elements.
Reads the title="[target path or absolute URL with repository]" attribute of those elements.
Gets the file details of the target URL using AJAX, and prints as contents of the element.

Printed html is formatted using CSS.

What is the standard HTML for name/value lists? How do we do with the nested properties list?

Examples:
- one div class="filedetails" for each file in a directory listing.
- a single div in an upload-new-version page
- simply pull the mime type from the server using a client side script, for example to modify the directory listing icons where the filename extension does not match the mimetype
