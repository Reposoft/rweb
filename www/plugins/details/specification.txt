repos.se details plugin
-----------------------

Looks through the page for class="filedetails" elements.
Reads the title="[target path or absolute URL with repository]" attribute of those elements.
Gets the file details of the target URL using AJAX, and prints as contents of the element.

Printed html is formatted using CSS.

What is the standard HTML for name/value lists? How do we do with the nested properties list?
