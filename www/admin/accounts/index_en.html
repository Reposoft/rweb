<h1>Account administration</h1>
<p>Repos user accounts are stored in the repository. Each user has a personal folder.
These folders can be kept private (with access denied even for members of the administration group).
If a user has lost the password, the user's settings are not longer accessible.
But through this page, a user's password can be temporarily reset so that the user can update the settings.
</p>
<p>The /admin folder in Repos normally has access allowed only for certain client addresses,
unlike the repository /administration folder, which is controlled by the ACL.
This page admin/accounts/ is currently only restricted on IPs.
It would be simple to verify access in the repository too.

<h3>Reset user password</h3>
<p>This creates a temporary password for the user,
which you as administrator can hand over (it will not be e-mailed).
Normally users should handle this on their own, having a valid e-mail address in settiongs.
</p>
<form action="../accountreset/" method="get">
<p><label for="username">username</label><input type="text" id="username" name="username" />
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Reset"/></p>
</form>

<h3>Revert user password</h3>
<p>Use this operation to manually restore a password that has been reset by mistake.
It is the same operation that Repos does when a user commits changes to the settings file.
The login details from the repository are exported to the server,
so the new password becomes effective.
</p>
<form action="../accountrevert/" method="get">
<p><label for="username">username</label><input type="text" id="username" name="username" />
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Reset"/></p>
</form>

<h3><a id="usercreate" href="../../account/create/">Create a user account</a></h3>
<p>This operation requires login to the repository administration area (with write access).
Being inside repos/admin/, it also requires an administration client. That is because
the number of users in Repos is relevant to the licensing.
</p>

<h3><a id="userdelete" href="../../account/delete/">Delete user account</a></h3>
<p>Deletes the account's folder in repository root,
deletes the entries in the ACL, and deletes any group memberships in the ACL.
