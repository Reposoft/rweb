<h1>Demoproject data storage policy</h1>
<p>All project artefacts are stored in this repository. 
That way we all know where the latest version is, and we can use the URLs instead of attachments.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> The repository keeps the complete history of every file. 
Because of this traceability, anyone can edit any document, and revciews of the changes can be done at any time.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The data on local hard drives in not backed up. 
That saves us buth money and time. 
Instead files that matter should be stored in the repository (personal files can be stored in the personal folder). The repository is kept at a secure server, and mirrored to a different geographical location. 
So even if every piece of hardware is stolen from the office, we still have our data.
</p>
<h3>Outside the office</h3>
<p>Keep a minimal set of data on your portable computers, in case of theft. 
You can access the files in the repository from anywhere (connection is encrypted so it is safe to use on WLAN and dialup from you mobile too).</p>
<h2>File formats</h2>
<p>The repository stores any type of file. 
However text based formats are more suitable for version control, as two versions can be compared line by line.
</p>
<p>So for Office documents, please use the xml format. 
That is default in Office 2007, but in Office 2003 you need to manually select &quot;xml&quot; in the Save As dialog.
</p>
<p>For text documents, HTML is a good format.</p>
