Base classes for working copy management, not containing any user interaction logic.
</p>
<p>
Most svn clients are made for four different usage scenarios:
online automated,
working copy automated,
online user,
working copy user.
This client is made for use from an application (automated) and only in working copies (no online operations).
This minimizes the feature set. For example copy+delete methods makes it unnessecary to add move.
</p>
<p>
The actual client logic should be embedded in a class that encapsulates a usage pattern, 
such as <a href="../simple/">simple client</a> or <a href="../managed/">managed client</a>.
