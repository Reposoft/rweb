### Set global-ignores to a set of whitespace-delimited globs
### which Subversion will ignore in its 'status' output, and
### while importing or adding files and directories.
### '*' matches leading dots, e.g. '*.rej' matches '.foo.rej'.
# global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la *.al .libs *.so *.so.[0-9]* *.a *.pyc *.pyo __pycache__
#   *.rej *~ #*# .#* .*.swp .DS_Store [Tt]humbs.db
### Set log-encoding to the default encoding for log messages
# log-encoding = latin1
### Set use-commit-times to make checkout/update/switch/revert
### put last-committed timestamps on every file touched.
# use-commit-times = yes
### Set no-unlock to prevent 'svn commit' from automatically
### releasing locks on files.
# no-unlock = yes
### Set mime-types-file to a MIME type registry file, used to
### provide hints to Subversion's MIME type auto-detection
### algorithm.
# mime-types-file = /path/to/mime.types
### Set preserved-conflict-file-exts to a whitespace-delimited
### list of patterns matching file extensions which should be
### preserved in generated conflict file names.  By default,
### conflict files use custom extensions.
# preserved-conflict-file-exts = doc ppt xls od?
### Set enable-auto-props to 'yes' to enable automatic properties
### for 'svn add' and 'svn import', it defaults to 'no'.
### Automatic properties are defined in the section 'auto-props'.
enable-auto-props = yes
### Set interactive-conflicts to 'no' to disable interactive
### conflict resolution prompting.  It defaults to 'yes'.
interactive-conflicts = no
### Set memory-cache-size to define the size of the memory cache
### used by the client when accessing a FSFS repository via
### ra_local (the file:// scheme). The value represents the number
### of MB used by the cache.
# memory-cache-size = 16
### Set diff-ignore-content-type to 'yes' to cause 'svn diff' to
### attempt to show differences of all modified files regardless
### of their MIME content type.  By default, Subversion will only
### attempt to show differences for files believed to have human-
### readable (non-binary) content.  This option is especially
### useful when Subversion is configured (via the 'diff-cmd'
### option) to employ an external differencing tool which is able
### to show meaningful differences for binary file formats.  [New
### in 1.9]
# diff-ignore-content-type = no

*.js = svn:eol-style=native;svn:mime-type=text/javascript
*.css = svn:eol-style=native;svn:mime-type=text/css
# allow svn to identify binary files for the rest, like .doc

[working-copy]
### Set to a list of the names of specific clients that should use
### exclusive SQLite locking of working copies.  This increases the
### performance of the client but prevents concurrent access by
### other clients.  Third-party clients may also support this
### option.
### Possible values:
###   svn                (the command line client)
# exclusive-locking-clients =
### Set to true to enable exclusive SQLite locking of working
### copies by all clients using the 1.8 APIs.  Enabling this may
### cause some clients to fail to work properly. This does not have
### to be set for exclusive-locking-clients to work.
# exclusive-locking = false
### Set the SQLite busy timeout in milliseconds: the maximum time
### the client waits to get access to the SQLite database before
### returning an error.  The default is 10000, i.e. 10 seconds.
### Longer values may be useful when exclusive locking is enabled.
# busy-timeout = 10000
