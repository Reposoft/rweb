<h1>Delete account</h1>
<p>This has to be done manually.
Repos can not know how the user has been integrated with the repository.
It usually involved these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the <code>[/username]</code> section from the ACL.</li>
<li>Remove the username from any groups that he/she is member of.</li>
<li>If the user has a home folder, that folder can be deleted.
This does not free up any storage space, but makes the folder name available for others.
Please note that if others are given access to that path in the ACL, they can also access the history.</li>
<li>The user may still have an account stored in the Repos server for some time,
but if there are no entries in the ACL he/she can not access repository contents.
If this is a problem, ask a server administrator to remove the account from the users file.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>This process can of course be automated to suit you.
Please contact the Repos team for more information.</p>
